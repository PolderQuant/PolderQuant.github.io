# Data Science Project – Machine Learning for Sentiment Classification
**Coordinator & Examiner**: dr. L. Hoesch  
This course immerses students in a real-world data science case study focused on developing a sentiment classification model. Teams work under time constraints to create an NLP-based machine learning solution in Python, deploy their model as an API, and compare performance on a public leaderboard.

#### Objectives
- Translate theoretical econometric and data science knowledge into robust text analytics solutions.  
- Collaborate efficiently in teams to manage the entire lifecycle of a machine learning project.  
- Strengthen communication skills through technical report writing, presentations, and peer discussion.

### Course Content
- Real-Time Brand Analysis: Build sentiment classification tools to monitor social media and product reviews.  
- Hands-On Machine Learning: Utilize frameworks such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch for model development.  
- API Deployment: Package and serve the trained model, enabling real-time predictions and external integration.  
- Iterative Improvement: Gain feedback via a public leaderboard and refine model performance over the project cycle.

### Content Outline
- Data Extraction and Pre-Processing: Acquire labeled text from a relational database; clean and visualize the corpus.  
- Sample Splitting: Balance train, validation, and test sets to control overfitting.  
- Encoder Engineering: Tokenize and vectorize text using techniques like TF-IDF, n-grams, or advanced embeddings.  
- Classifier Development: Experiment with parametric (e.g., logistic regression) and non-parametric (e.g., random forest) methods.  
- Performance Evaluation: Employ confusion matrices, precision/recall metrics, and F1 scores to gauge predictive power.
