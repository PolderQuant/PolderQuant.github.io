# Multivariate Statistics
**Coordinator & Examiner:** dr. I. De Vos  
Multivariate Statistics delves into statistical methods designed for analyzing high-dimensional and interdependent data. Students learn both the theoretical underpinnings and hands-on applications of multivariate techniques.

### Objectives
- Recognize suitable multivariate methods for diverse data structures  
- Implement and apply selected techniques using statistical software  
- Interpret and clearly report outcomes in line with academic standards  

### Course Content
- Multivariate distributions (normal, t, Wishart)  
- Flexible multivariate techniques (mixture models, copulae)  
- Dimension reduction methods (principal components, factor analysis)  
- Classification techniques (clustering)  
- Application to real and simulated datasets  

### Key Topics
- Theoretical properties of multivariate distributions  
- Model selection and evaluation in multivariate settings  
- Practical software implementations (e.g., R, Python)  
- Reporting and interpreting results academically
