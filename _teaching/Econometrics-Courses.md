Econometric theory ranges from foundational linear regression methods—covering OLS, WLS, and maximum likelihood estimation—to advanced panel data and multivariate time-series models, culminating in specialized financial applications such as GARCH. Across all modules, students refine their statistical, computational, and empirical skills for rigorous data analysis and informed economic modeling.

# Econometrics I
**Coordinator & Examiner:** dr. J.M.A. Telg  
Econometrics I lays the foundation for understanding and applying linear regression models to cross-sectional data. The course is divided into two periods: 
- **Period 1:** Focus on simple linear regression (one explanatory variable)  
- **Period 2:** Transition to multiple linear regression (matrix algebra approach)  

### Objectives
- Develop a thorough understanding of linear regression for cross-sectional data.  
- Derive and analyze estimators (Ordinary Least Squares, Weighted Least Squares, Maximum Likelihood) in linear models.  
- Understand finite-sample and asymptotic properties of these estimators.  
- Perform hypothesis testing and diagnostic analysis (t-tests, F-tests, confidence intervals).  
- Predict outcomes and assess model fit.

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Formulate and estimate linear regression models.  
- Test statistical hypotheses and construct confidence intervals.  
- Evaluate model assumptions and check model fit.  
- Use matrix algebra to implement multiple linear regression.  

### Key Topics
- Estimation methods (OLS, WLS, ML)  
- Assumptions on the linear regression model  
- Hypothesis testing and diagnostic checking  
- Finite-sample and asymptotic properties  
- Prediction and prediction intervals

# Econometrics II
**Coordinator & Examiner:** dr. L.F. Hoogerheide  
Econometrics II addresses issues that arise when the classical linear regression model assumptions are violated and explores various model extensions for more complex data situations.
### Objectives
- Understand common misspecifications in linear regression (heteroskedasticity, endogeneity).  
- Learn to apply instrumental variables.  
- Familiarize with regression models for time series data.  
- Explore logistic and probit models for binary and multinomial data.  
- Study tobit models for censored/truncated data.

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Detect and correct for heteroskedasticity and serial correlation.  
- Identify and handle endogeneity via instrumental variables.  
- Model discrete outcomes using logit/probit approaches.  
- Recognize and address nonlinearities and dummy variable inclusion.

### Key Topics
- Heteroskedasticity  
- Instrumental variables & endogeneity  
- Misspecification (non-linearity, dummy variables)  
- Time series regression (serial correlation)  
- Binary choice models (logit, probit)  
- Multinomial models (ordered logit/probit, multinomial logit)  
- Censored/truncated data (tobit models)  
- Non-normality considerations

# Econometrics III
**Coordinator & Examiner:** prof. dr. S.J. Koopman  
Econometrics III focuses on multivariate econometric methods including panel data analysis and multivariate time-series techniques (VAR, cointegration, VECM). It is a more advanced course blending theory, practice, and empirical analysis.
### Objectives
- Gain knowledge of seemingly unrelated regressions and advanced panel data models.  
- Acquire the ability to model multivariate time series using VAR, impulse response functions, and error-correction mechanisms.  
- Understand estimation techniques for panel and time-series models.

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Formulate and estimate panel data models (fixed effects, random effects, two-error component models).  
- Set up and interpret vector autoregressive (VAR) models.  
- Conduct cointegration analysis and build vector error correction models (VECM).  
- Implement these methods in empirical research settings.

### Key Topics
- Seemingly unrelated regressions  
- Panel data methods (fixed, random effects)  
- Difference-in-differences approaches  
- Vector autoregressive models (VAR) and impulse responses  
- Cointegration and vector error correction models

# Financial Econometrics
**Coordinator & Examiner:** dr. P. Gorgi  
Financial Econometrics bridges theoretical models and real-world financial data applications. This course introduces time-varying parameter models widely used in Finance and emphasizes both theoretical understanding and computational implementation.
### Objectives
- Explore and implement econometric methods for measuring financial risk and volatility.  
- Learn modern models (e.g., GARCH-type, time-varying parameter models) relevant to finance.  
- Develop coding and data analysis skills for financial data.  
- Prepare for Master’s-level courses in (Financial) Econometrics and Bachelor’s thesis work.

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Design, estimate, and analyze time-varying parameter models.  
- Understand key modeling assumptions and their implications.  
- Apply computational methods to handle real financial datasets.  
- Perform volatility forecasting and portfolio optimization with advanced models.  

### Key Topics
- GARCH models and volatility forecasting  
- Observation-driven vs. parameter-driven models  
- Nonlinearities and latent variables in financial data  
- Portfolio optimization strategies  
- Simulation-based econometric methods
