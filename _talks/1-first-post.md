Welcome to my blog, where I document my journey in quantitative finance, data science, and mathematics, sharing insights, experiments, and lessons along the way.

# Welcome to My Corner of the Internet!

Hi there! I'm Samuel, an Econometrics & Data Science student at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. If you’ve stumbled upon this blog, welcome! I’m here to share my journey, thoughts, and experiments in the fascinating world of quantitative finance, mathematics, and whatever else I find interesting along the way.

### About Me  
My academic life revolves around econometrics, data science, and the challenge of making sense of messy data to uncover patterns and insights. Over the years, I've had the chance to dive deep into topics like financial econometrics, time series modeling, and multivariate statistics. Think volatility modeling, dynamic portfolio optimization, and occasionally, trying not to let my code break at the worst moment.

Outside of lectures and assignments, I’ve been lucky to gain hands-on experience as a Pricing Analyst at bol.com, where I worked on improving pricing algorithms and performing market research, and as a Data Scientist in the telecom sector, building tools to analyze, model and forecast power consumption. Currently, I’m working as a Quantitative Analyst on a prop trading desk, learning the ins and outs of agricultural commodities. It’s been a steep learning curve, but I wouldn’t have it any other way.

### Why This Blog?  
This blog is my space to share ideas, experiments, and things I’m learning about quantitative finance and beyond. Some posts might delve into algorithmic trading strategies, others might explore mathematical concepts, or maybe even random tidbits about a dataset that caught my attention.

But it’s not just about finance and math—I see this as a way to explore and discuss anything I find exciting or thought-provoking. Maybe a book I read, an algorithm I came across, or even a peculiar market anomaly. Who knows? Who cares?
This isn’t about being an expert or showing off. I’m very much still learning, making mistakes, and figuring things out as I go. My goal is to create a space that serves as a map of my journey—not so much looking into the future, but reflecting on the past and documenting the steps I’ve taken along the way. It’s a way to capture the lessons, experiments, and discoveries that have shaped my understanding of quantitative finance, mathematics, and beyond.
